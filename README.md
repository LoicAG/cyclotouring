# Cyclo-touring .gpx files

This repo of .gpx is made for my own personal usage, but I'm publishing it in the hope that someone may find it useful some day.

## Tools used

I use the following tools:

- [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com)
- [mapstogpx.com](https://mapstogpx.com/)
- [GPXSee](https://www.gpxsee.org/)
- ...and of course, vim :)
